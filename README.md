# Rcp
Computation of the minimal integral models for the Principal Series Weil Representations of SL(2,F_p).

 This script, Rcp, computes the irreducible representation R(c,+) for SL_2(Z/pZ) using the quadratic form cx^2/5 and bilinear form is 2cxy/5 given the prime p  and a quadratic non-residue c.  It also computes it for when c=1. These principal series Weil representations' entries are in the minimal integral model.  See the paper "Minimal Integral Models for Principal Series Weil Characters" which describes my central PhD dissertation result: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00927872.2023.2222407  or  https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14556   .  arxiv is free ;-).
